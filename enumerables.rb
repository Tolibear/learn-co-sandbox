array.each

each is the least expressive and least useful enumerable! avoid and use something better if possible! Harder to tell the intention with each vs something like map or reduce or max etc

each is best used for when you arent transforming data, like when you want to print something to the screen, or if you arent quite sure which enumerable you need.
